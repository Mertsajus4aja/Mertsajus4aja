- 👋 Hi, I’m Katrin.In my life, I have a lot to do with analyzing large amounts of data. I worked and still work as a Chief Accountant. But now I have decided to change the field, studied machine learning on Python and am now going through the second step in stepik.
- 👀  First of all, I am interested in collaboration with the goals of collecting, parsing and analyzing databases designed to help restore and protect the environment. Projects on the analysis of natural phenomena, migration, poaching bases. But I'm also interested in genetic engineering projects and statistics.
- 💞️ I'm mastering the second stage of python on Stepik, I'm starting to write projects, while chatbots and simple games as exercises
